## matrices for describing the multi-camera layout for parking lot

# fps is the frame rate of each camera (parking_a, parking_b, parking_c)

# offsets denote the time difference between cameras
# assuming all videos are synchronized (adjust if needed)

# The (i,j)-th element of the compatibility matrix shows whether a track from
# the j-th camera can be appended to one in the i-th camera.

# The (i,j)-th element of dtmin and dtmax denotes the timeframe for matching.
# If the track left camera i at t, it has to appear on j 
# in the interval [t - dtmin, t + dtmax]
# infinity is denoted by -inf or inf.
